   photocontrol
   Turns on an LED when the analog read value from a 
   photresisitor (in a voltage dividor) is less than
   775.

   This program is for the Week 2 assignment in the
   Coursera Interfacing with the Arduino course.

   Instructions:
      Build a circuit that lights an LED when it is 
      sufficiently dark in a room. Demonstrate the circuit 
      by covering the photoresistor to simulate darkness.
